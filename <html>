Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) 
Collision Damage Waiver reduces the renter's liability from the total cost of the damage to an excess amount,
where applicable, unless the renter intentionally causes the damage, is under the influence of drink or drugs,
or uses the car in a prohibited or negligent way – such as driving off main roads or hiring to other parties.
CDW covers liability for damage to the car or its parts. In most locations, windscreens, tyres, undercarriage, 
replacement locks, replacement keys and towing charges are not covered under the CDW policy. Other exclusions
may apply and can differ between car hire companies, so we recommend checking these exclusions with the car 
hire company when picking the car up.
</p>

<p>
Personal Accident Insurance (PAI) 
This optional insurance may be covered by your holiday insurance (please check before you, the renter, travel).
If you require PAI, it can be purchased at the car hire counter when you pick the car up. </p>

<p>
Theft Protection (TP) 
Theft Protection reduces the renter's liability in the event of theft or damage caused due to theft or attempted
theft of the car to an excess amount, where applicable. Negligence connected with the theft of/damage to the car
may lead to the car hire company requiring the full amount for the cost of the car.</p>

<p>
Out-of-Hours Service 
At most airport locations, flights will be met and cars supplied outside normal working hours. However, there may
be an additional charge for this service, which will be payable directly to the car hire company. We will advise
you, the renter, whether a charge will apply when you confirm your pick-up times in your booking request. In the
event that a flight delay causes the car pick-up to fall outside a car hire company’s normal working hours, the
car hire company may agree to provide an out-of-hours service – in which case they will advise you of any fee.
We can accept no further responsibility where there is no out-of-hours service available – and it is therefore
recommended that you, the renter, take independent travel insurance. Non-airport car hire counters may also
provide an out-of-hours service.</p>

<p>
Minimum / Maximum Age Limitations
In most locations, the minimum hiring age is 21 years. Additional fees can apply with certain car hire companies
and in certain countries for drivers aged under 25 years or over 65 years: where the correct driver age has been
submitted with the booking request, we will advise of any likely fees. Minimum age requirements on larger cars may
also be higher at some locations. 

If You, the Renter, Wish to Make Changes to Your Booking 
No charge will be made for amending your booking before the start of your rental. This excludes any cost increases
caused by a material change to the booking, such as its duration or the car class – or by the car hire company
changing its rates following the original booking. With certain car hire companies, amending the driver’s name
or the pick-up location may require the cancellation and re-booking of a rental. To cancel your booking, please
log in to the Cancel Booking facility, and click Cancel Booking. Terms & conditions vary per car hire company 
and will be clearly communicated during the booking process.</p>

<p>
Driving Licence 
Drivers must produce a valid driving licence held for at least 1 year (2 years in selected locations; this will
be confirmed during the booking process). Our Contact Centre must be advised of any endorsements / points on a
driving licence at the time of booking; we reserve the right to refuse the booking on this basis, according to
our car hire companies’ terms & conditions. All persons driving the car must be in possession of their driving 
licence at all times, for perusal by local authorities. No refunds will be given if a car hire company refuses
to supply a car due to non-production of a driving licence or undisclosed endorsements. Please note that an
International Driving Licence/Permit does not replace the requirement for a regular driving licence: a full driving
licence in the main driver’s name will still be mandatory in order to rent the car.</p>
